# Outfit of The Day

"Revamp your style, effortlessly"

The outfit-saving app is designed to make it easy for users to keep track of their fashion choices and organize their wardrobe. With the ability to save photos of clothing items, users can create different outfit combinations and store them for future reference.

One of the app's key features is the ability to name each outfit, allowing users to easily identify and recall what they wore on specific occasions. Additionally, the app makes it simple to sort and categorize outfits based on different criteria such as style, occasion, and weather.
